"Function calling" in AI—particularly in the context of modern large language models (LLMs) like GPT—refers to the ability of the AI to invoke external functions or structured APIs based on a user’s query. This allows the model to interact with tools, databases, or software systems to perform more complex or dynamic tasks.

🔧 What is Function Calling in AI?
It's a way for an AI model to:

Understand that a user’s request maps to a specific function (like getWeather(city)).

Fill in the necessary parameters from the user’s query.

Call the function via an API or code.

Return and format the result to the user.

✅ Example Scenario
User query:

"What’s the weather like in Paris tomorrow?"

Behind the scenes:

The AI recognizes the intent: get weather.

It extracts the parameters: city = "Paris", date = "tomorrow".

It calls a function:


get_weather(city="Paris", date="2025-08-05")
The function returns the result.

The AI formats and presents the answer.

📦 Why It's Useful
Function calling allows LLMs to:

Access live data (like stock prices, weather, calendars).

Trigger custom workflows (like booking a meeting, placing an order).

Interface with databases, software systems, or internal APIs.

Improve accuracy, since function results are computed directly rather than generated from the model's memory.

🔍 Use in OpenAI’s GPT (ChatGPT)
In OpenAI’s GPT-4, developers can define functions (tools) using JSON schema, and the model will automatically:

Decide whether a function is needed.

Generate arguments for the function.

Use the result to continue the conversation.

This is part of tool use or function calling API.

💡 Example Use Case (JSON)
Function definition (schema):

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Get the weather forecast for a city",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "city": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The name of the city"
      },
      "date": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "date",
        "description": "The date of the forecast"
      }
    },
    "required": ["city", "date"]
  }
}
✅ Use Case:
Get Weather – for a given city.

Get Stock Price – for a given company.

Place an Order – to order a product.
Additional Tools:
📅 Calendar Integration (e.g. Google Calendar)

🪑 Reservation System (e.g. restaurant or appointment booking)

🔌 Custom APIs (e.g. your own business system or backend)

🔧 OVERVIEW
Tool	Function Name	What it Does
Weather	get_weather	Real-time weather from OpenWeatherMap
Stock	get_stock_price	Real-time price from Yahoo Finance
Order	place_order	Create Stripe charge for product
Calendar	create_calendar_event	Adds event to calendar (Google API)
Reservation	book_reservation	Books a table or appointment
Custom API	get_custom_data	Queries your own backend or DB
GPT-4 function calling with the following tools:

🌤️ OpenWeatherMap (weather)

📈 Yahoo Finance (yfinance)

🛒 Stripe (order placement)

📅 Google Calendar (event creation)

🪑 Reservation system (mocked)

🔌 Custom API (user-defined)

✅ Example Usage
User types:

"What's the weather in Paris, the price of TSLA, book dinner for 2 in NYC at 7pm on Friday, and schedule a call at 3pm tomorrow."

GPT-4:

Calls OpenWeatherMap

Pulls TSLA price

Mocks a reservation

Creates a Google Calendar event

All replies appear in the UI!

🧩 Want to Deploy?
You can host this on:

Render, Fly.io, or Heroku for the Flask backend

Netlify or Vercel (if you separate UI)

Use Docker for containerization
